  <h1>LUCADI</h1>
  <h2>Revolutionary accounting system for small businesses</h2>
 <p>Book-keeping and paperwork are a nightmare for small businesses. Everyone knows how important it is to keep them up to date, but after
 working long hours making and selling great stuff, who wants to spend yet more hours wading through little bits of paper to get things right?</p>
 <p>We wish we could say LUCADI would do it all for you.<em> We're working on it</em>, </p>
 <p><strong>We think LUCADI already makes it much, much  easier than anything else out there.</strong>  </p>
 <h2>Want to know how?</h2>
 <ul>
 <li>LUCADI tells you what to do, how to do it, and nags you to do it on time. </li>
 <li>LUCADI is task-based. For every task there's a quick and simple form.</li>
 <li>LUCADI will fit your business. There are LUCADI modules for many different trades, with more being added all the time.</li>
 </ul>
 <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-L4lkPsiNqYPNwz8BtiBjBAV7rzwOXDXkxWtqRgzNIk/edit?usp=sharing">Take this quick tour.....</a></p>
 <p>If you use LUCADI correctly, visits from the tax inspector will be a breeze.  You'll never get a fine for late returns. What's more,
 your accountant will hate you - because she'll have hardly any work to do and won't be able to charge you so much!</p>
 <p> We know small businesses are happy to pay their fair share of tax like everyone else...</p>
 <p> Well, perhaps "happy" isn't quite the right word... "OK about paying?"</p>
 <p> If only we didn't have to do the paperwork, or put up with HMRC's assessments....
 <p> LUCADI calculates your tax liabilities accurately, first time. And submits your returns automatically!</p>
 <h2><a href="./Platax.html?gwt.codesvr=127.0.0.1:9997">Three Months' free Trial</a></h2>
 <p>LUCADI is free for the first three months. We're so confident of our system that we're sure you'll want to continue afterwards. </p>

/**
 * In most cases, PWS uses standard GWT widgets wrapped/grouped in a FlowPanel to make the value fields.
 * However, all PWS fields must implement HasValue and perversely some of the GWT input widgets don't,
 * specifically ListBox.
 * 
 *  There are some other gotchas with the standard widgets so this package provides alternatives where needed.

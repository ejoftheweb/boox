           <content>We are proud to support CEP, the Campaign to Eliminate Paperwork. We believe that paperwork is the bane of everyone working in
               or running a small enterprise and we'd like to see it eliminated entirely. We can dream! There are three angles to the campaign:
               legislation, technology and standards.</content>

           <head>Legislation</head>
           <content>We don't favour a bonfire of regulations: health and safety, tax compliance, environmental rules are all good causes and small
               enterprises should comply. But we'd like to see compliance made as easy as possible, without paperwork.

               Technology is our best hope for eliminating paperwork. The paperless office has been a dream for decades; here at Platosys, we're
               trying to make it a reality for small businesses.

               To eliminate  paperwork, we need to eliminate  paper receipts and bills. But we still need to record earnings and expenses, so we 
               need to replace paper with digital, and replace manual handling with automatic posting. We need to develop universal standards
               for the digital formats of receipts and bills.

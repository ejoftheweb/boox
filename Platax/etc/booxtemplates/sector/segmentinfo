This folder contains xml files with the accounts structure for the sector segment. 
There should be one file for each module in the segment and the filename is the same as the 
module name. The files are all listed in the boox.xml manifest file in the templates root folder.

The sector segment contains modules for different business sectors - e.g catering and hospitality, 
building trades, property development, residential letting, consultancy, professional services etc.

It is a mulit-selection segment - an enterprise can use zero or more of these modules.

This folder contains xml files with the accounts structure for the operations segment. 
There should be one file for each module in the segment and the filename is the same as the 
module name. The files are all listed in the boox.xml manifest file in the templates root folder.

The operations segment is concerned with how the business operates, e.g. handles cash, payments, etc. If 
it takes card payments, for example, it should load the cards module. 

It is a mulit-selection segment - an enterprise can use zero or more of these modules.

This folder contains xml files with the accounts structure for the overhead segment. 
There should be one file for each module in the segment and the filename is the same as the 
module name. The files are all listed in the boox.xml manifest file in the templates root folder.

The overhead segment is concerned with the business overheads such as premises and vehicles. If it rents
leasehold premises it should select this module which will set up tasks and accounts for rent, business rates,
utilities, buildings insurance etc.

It is a mulit-selection segment - an enterprise can use zero or more of these modules.

This folder contains xml files with the accounts structure for the capital segment. 
There should be one file for each module in the segment and the filename is the same as the 
module name. The files are all listed in the boox.xml manifest file in the templates root folder.

The capital segment is concerned with ownership of the enterprise, whether it is a company limited 
by shares, by guarantee, or is a partnership, a trust, or a sole trader.

It is a single-selection segment - an enterprise can have one, and only one, of these structures.
